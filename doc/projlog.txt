07/06/2025: Add FIFO Depth Reg to FIFO, completed basic FIFO read & write test.
07/07/2025: Add detailed FIFO Depth Reg with address and fields definition, completed FIFO read & write test under different reg setting
07/08/2025: Add APB interface, map all internal signals to APB bus signals, plan to write tb on 07/09.
07/09/2025: Server was down, rest for one day.
07/10/2025: Tested APB IO, looks very good. Plan to finish invalid addresses access situation in DUT and write more tb on 07/11.  
07/11/2025: Added invalid addresses access code, wrote tb to test it, looks good. Start building UVM env.
07/12/2025: Research on Easier UVM Code Generator.
07/13/2025: 
07/14/2025: Quit using Easier UVM. Created interface ,txn, bfm, driver, sequence, sequencer, package.
07/15/2025: Add monitor module. Research on time slot & clocking block. Revised interface module.
07/16/2025: Decide to add virtual sequence and virtual sequencer, creating scoreboard module.
07/17/2025: Completed agent, vsqr, vseq, scoreboard, env. Plan to make it DUO top structure tmr. 
07/18/2025: Completed DUO top files, added Makefile and tb.f, failed to run the UVM due to chaotic file structure.
07/19/2025: Successfully compile all the files, created a Makefile, plan to write tests tmr.
07/20/2025: 
07/21/2025: Run the UVM for the first time. Write txn works well, read txn failed to read data. Draw the current system structure fig.
07/22/2025: Fixed a bug that monitor could not get the correct txn result. (DUT not reset, set PRESETn the input signal of the interface)
07/23/2025: Fixed a DUT bug(PRDATA read condition error). Add monitor BFM function(Fixed a bug triggered by ref/output).
07/24/2025: Adding register model, writing reg model, reg block model, adapter and rgm sequence.
07/25/2025: Continue working on the reg model, planning the reg model structure.
07/26/2025: 
07/27/2025: 
07/28/2025: Finalize the design and update the structure fig, keep working on reg model. 
07/29/2025: Finish the construction of reg model, embedded it in the whole uvm structure, plan to test it tmr.
07/30/2025: Deleted reg sequence file, rearrange RGM according to uvm cookbook.
07/31/2025: RGM default map is null, cause runtime error. Fixed by call .build. Add new dummy reg sv file. Successfully run the base test with RGM installed. Tested RGM read write, correct txns were sent however could not get correct rgm.read result.
08/01/2025: 
08/02/2025: Fixed RGM read bug by checking adapter->driver.rsp->bfm, Fixed bfm.drive_txn T2 timing error.
08/03/2025:
08/04/2025: Re-arrange the Vseq structure, make it layered structure to run different test cases for coverage purpose. 
08/05/2025: 
08/06/2025: Fixed a bug by assigning txn.strob in rgm adapter. Finished REG_01 - REG_09 Test.
08/07/2025: 
08/08/2025: Added coverage module to the UVM, tested dummy coverage group. Designing coverage bins.
