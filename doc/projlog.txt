07/06/2025: Add FIFO Depth Reg to FIFO, completed basic FIFO read & write test.
07/07/2025: Add detailed FIFO Depth Reg with address and fields definition, completed FIFO read & write test under different reg setting
07/08/2025: Add APB interface, map all internal signals to APB bus signals, plan to write tb on 07/09.
07/09/2025: Server was down, rest for one day.
07/10/2025: Tested APB IO, looks very good. Plan to finish invalid addresses access situation in DUT and write more tb on 07/11.  
07/11/2025: Added invalid addresses access code, wrote tb to test it, looks good. Start building UVM env.
07/12/2025: Research on Easier UVM Code Generator.
07/13/2025: 
07/14/2025: Quit using Easier UVM. Created interface ,txn, bfm, driver, sequence, sequencer, package.
07/15/2025: Add monitor module. Research on time slot & clocking block. Revised interface module.
07/16/2025: Decide to add virtual sequence and virtual sequencer, creating scoreboard module.
07/17/2025: Completed agent, vsqr, vseq, scoreboard, env. Plan to make it DUO top structure tmr. 
07/18/2025: Completed DUO top files, added Makefile and tb.f, failed to run the UVM due to chaotic file structure.
07/19/2025: Successfully compile all the files, created a Makefile, plan to write tests tmr.
07/20/2025: 
07/21/2025: Run the UVM for the first time. Write txn works well, read txn failed to read data. Draw the current system structure with visio. 
07/22/2025: Fixed a bug that monitor could not get the correct txn result. (DUT not reset, set PRESETn the input signal of the interface)
07/23/2025: Fixed a DUT bug(PRDATA read condition error). Add monitor BFM function.
